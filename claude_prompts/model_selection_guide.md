## Model Selection Override

### When to Override Automatic Selection

**Upgrade to Higher Model**:
- User has specific quality requirements
- Task has hidden complexity not captured in assessment
- Previous attempts with lower model were insufficient
- Critical deadline or high-stakes implementation

**Downgrade to Lower Model**:
- User wants to optimize costs
- Task is simpler than assessment suggests
- Exploratory or prototype work
- Non-critical implementation

### Override Mechanisms

**In Phase 1 (Context Planning)**:
- Modify the **Task Complexity** assessment
- Update **Recommended Model** in the assessment output
- Provide **Rationale** for the override

**In Phase 2 (Implementation)**:
- Update TodoWrite entries with different model assignments
- Modify task descriptions to include `[Model: override-model]`
- Document override reasoning in implementation notes

**In Phase 3 (Review)**:
- Request specific model for review process
- Use different model for cross-validation
- Escalate to higher model if issues identified

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Task Batching
- Group similar complexity tasks for same model
- Batch simple tasks to maximize Haiku 3.5 usage
- Reserve Opus 4 for truly complex work

### Progressive Complexity
- Start with simpler model and escalate if needed
- Use Haiku 3.5 for initial exploration
- Upgrade to Sonnet 4 for implementation
- Reserve Opus 4 for complex problem-solving

### Context Efficiency
- Optimize prompt content for model capabilities
- Use more detailed prompts for simpler models
- Leverage extended thinking mode appropriately
- Minimize context switching between models

## Quality Assurance

### Model Selection Validation
- Verify model choice matches task complexity
- Check for over-engineering or under-engineering
- Validate cost/performance trade-offs
- Ensure quality standards are maintained

### Fallback Strategies
- Escalate to higher model if quality issues
- Use cross-validation for critical decisions
- Implement review processes for complex tasks
- Maintain quality gates regardless of model choice

### Performance Monitoring
- Track model effectiveness per task type
- Monitor cost optimization results
- Adjust selection criteria based on experience
- Document lessons learned for future reference

## Best Practices

### Model Selection
1. **Start conservative**: Begin with automatic selection
2. **Monitor results**: Track quality and cost outcomes
3. **Adjust as needed**: Override when patterns emerge
4. **Document decisions**: Record override rationale

### Cost Management
1. **Optimize batch work**: Group similar tasks
2. **Use progressive complexity**: Start simple, escalate as needed
3. **Monitor spend**: Track cost per task type
4. **Balance quality and cost**: Don't compromise critical work

### Quality Assurance
1. **Maintain standards**: Quality gates regardless of model
2. **Use cross-validation**: For complex or critical work
3. **Review regularly**: Assess model effectiveness
4. **Learn and adapt**: Improve selection over time

## Future Considerations

### Model Updates
- Framework will adapt to new model releases
- Selection criteria will evolve with capabilities
- Cost optimizations will improve over time
- User feedback will refine selection logic

### Advanced Features
- Machine learning selection based on historical data
- Dynamic model selection during implementation
- Cost budgeting and optimization tools
- Performance analytics and reporting

The LAD framework's model selection is designed to be both automatic and flexible, optimizing for cost and performance while maintaining the high quality standards that define the framework.
