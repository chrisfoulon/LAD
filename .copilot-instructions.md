# Global Copilot Instructions

Copilot, do not modify any files under .lad/.
All edits must occur outside .lad/, or in prompts/ when explicitly updating LAD itself.

Coding & formatting
* Follow PEP 8; run Black.
* Use type hints everywhere.
* External dependencies limited to numpy, pandas, requests.
* Target Python 3.11.

Testing & linting
* Write pytest unit tests mirroring module paths.
* Run flake8 with `--max-complexity=10`; keep complexity â‰¤ 10.
* Every function/class **must** include a **NumPy-style docstring** (Sections: Parameters, Returns, Raises, Examples).

Commits
* Use Conventional Commits. Example:  
  `feat(pipeline-filter): add ROI masking helper`
* Keep body as bullet list of sub-tasks completed.

Docs
* High-level docs live under the target project's `docs/` and are organised in three nested levels using `<details>` tags.
