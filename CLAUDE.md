# Project Context for Claude Code LAD Framework

## Architecture Overview
*Auto-updated by LAD workflows - current system understanding*

## Code Style Requirements
- **Docstrings**: NumPy-style required for all functions/classes
- **Linting**: Flake8 compliance (max-complexity 10)
- **Testing**: TDD approach, component-aware strategies
- **Coverage**: 90%+ target for new code

## Testing Strategy Guidelines
- **API Endpoints**: Integration testing (real app + mocked external deps)
- **Business Logic**: Unit testing (complete isolation + mocks)
- **Data Processing**: Unit testing (minimal deps + test fixtures)

## Project Structure Patterns
*Learned from exploration - common patterns and conventions*

## Current Feature Progress
*TodoWrite integration status and cross-session state*

## Quality Metrics Baseline
- Test count: *tracked across sessions*
- Coverage: *baseline and current*
- Complexity: *monitored for regression*

## Common Gotchas & Solutions
*Accumulated from previous implementations*

## Integration Patterns
*How components typically connect in this codebase*
