You are Claude, a senior dev lead. Integrate external review feedback into the plan, then evaluate for potential splitting.

### Inputs (attachments)
1. `docs/{{FEATURE_SLUG}}/plan.md`         ← original plan
2. `review_copilot.md`                     ← Copilot review (❌ bullets)
3. `review_chatgpt.md`                     ← ChatGPT review (❌ bullets)

### Phase 1: Integrate Review Feedback (Required)
1. Parse both review files; merge issues by category (Completeness, Order, Risk, Coverage, Maintainability, Security).  
2. For each issue:
   * If it requires a **new task**, add a checklist item with test path & size.  
   * If it requires **re-ordering**, adjust task numbers accordingly.  
   * If already covered, mark as "addressed".  
3. Insert a `<details><summary>Review-Resolution Log</summary>` block beneath the checklist summarising how each issue was handled.
4. Create the fully integrated plan with all feedback incorporated.

### Phase 2: Plan Complexity Evaluation (Optional)
**After integrating all reviews, evaluate the resulting plan for splitting using these criteria:**

**Size Metrics:**
- Task count > 6 suggests potential splitting
- Sub-task count > 25-30 indicates overwhelm risk
- Mix of S/M/L complexity across different domains

**Domain Analysis:**
- Security tasks separate from core functionality
- Performance optimization distinct from business logic
- API/interface tasks vs internal implementation
- Infrastructure vs application logic

**Dependency Assessment:**
- Natural architectural boundaries exist
- Task groupings with minimal cross-dependencies
- Foundation → Domain → Interface → Security/Performance flow possible

### Phase 3A: Single Plan Output (default path)
If complexity is manageable (≤6 tasks, ≤25 sub-tasks, single domain) OR splitting not beneficial:
1. Save integrated plan with Review-Resolution Log to `docs/{{FEATURE_SLUG}}/plan.md`
2. Print updated checklist
3. **Done** - proceed with standard implementation

### Phase 3B: Multi-Plan Output (when splitting beneficial)
**Only if splitting criteria are clearly met**, create sub-plan structure:

**Step 1: Generate Sub-Plan Breakdown**
Create 2-4 sub-plans following dependency order:
- **0a_foundation**: Core models, infrastructure, job management
- **0b_{{domain}}**: Business logic, pipeline integration
- **0c_interface**: API endpoints, external interfaces
- **0d_security**: Security, performance, compatibility testing

**Step 2: Create Sub-Plan Files**
For each sub-plan ID (0a, 0b, 0c, 0d):
- `plan_{{SUB_PLAN_ID}}.md` with focused task subset
- `context_{{SUB_PLAN_ID}}.md` with relevant documentation

**Step 3: Archive Original**
- Save complete integrated plan as `plan_master.md`
- Create `split_decision.md` documenting rationale and dependencies

**Step 4: Context Evolution Planning**
Document how each sub-plan updates context for subsequent ones:
- Foundation creates APIs → updates interface context
- Domain logic creates services → updates security context
- Interface creates endpoints → updates security context

### Deliverable
**Default (Single Plan)**: Updated `plan.md` with Review-Resolution Log + printed checklist
**Enhanced (Split Plans)**: Sub-plan files + `split_decision.md` + summary of sub-plan structure
