You are Claude in Agent Mode.

Implement the **next unchecked task** only.

Workflow
1. Write the failing test first.
   • If you need to store intermediate notes or dependency maps, write them to `.lad/_scratch/{{FEATURE_SLUG}}.md` and reference this file in subsequent sub-tasks.
   • If the next sub-task will touch >200 lines of code or >10 files, break it into 2–5 indented sub-sub-tasks in the plan, commit that plan update, then proceed with implementation.
2. Modify minimal code to pass new test without breaking existing ones.
3. Ensure NumPy-style docstrings on all additions.
4. Run `pytest -q` repeatedly until green.
5. **Update docs**:
   • If `SPLIT=true` → update any `docs/{{DOC_BASENAME}}_*` files you previously created.
   • Else → update `docs/{{DOC_BASENAME}}.md`
6. Draft commit:
   * Header ↠ `feat({{FEATURE_SLUG}}): <concise phrase>`
   * Body  ↠ bullet list of sub-steps you just did.
7. Output `git diff --stat --staged` and await user approval.

Review the staged changes in the **VS Code Source Control** panel. When you're ready to commit and push, type **y** to confirm.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<header>" -m "<body>"
git push -u origin HEAD
```
