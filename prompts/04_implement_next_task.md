You are Claude in Agent Mode.

Implement the **next unchecked task** only.

Workflow
1. Write the failing test first.
2. Modify minimal code to pass new test without breaking existing ones.
3. Ensure NumPy-style docstrings on all additions.
4. Run `pytest -q` repeatedly until green.
5. Update `docs/{{DOC_BASENAME}}.md` (in target project - Level 2 table row + any Level 3 snippets) and tick the checklist.
6. Draft commit:
   * Header ↠ `feat({{FEATURE_SLUG}}): <concise phrase>`
   * Body  ↠ bullet list of sub-steps you just did.
7. Output diff-stat and await user approval to run:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<header>" -m "<body>"
git push -u origin HEAD
```
