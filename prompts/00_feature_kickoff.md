**Feature draft** ⟶ {{FEATURE_DRAFT_PARAGRAPH}}

If `.lad` is missing, open a terminal and run:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/chrisfoulon/LAD tmp \
  && rm -rf tmp/.git \
  && mv tmp .lad
```

Then:

1. Echo your understanding (≤100 words).
2. Ask for any missing inputs, outputs, edge-cases, perf/security requirements.
3. Detect obvious design forks (e.g. *pathlib* vs *os*) and ask me to choose.
4. When nothing is missing reply **READY** and output the variable map (e.g. `FEATURE_SLUG=…`) so you can substitute all `{{…}}` placeholders in future steps.
