**Feature draft** ⟶ {{FEATURE_DRAFT_PARAGRAPH}}

⚠️ **Prerequisites**: Ensure `.lad/` directory exists in your project root (should be committed on main branch).

Then:

1. Echo your understanding (≤100 words).
2. Ask for any missing inputs, outputs, edge-cases, perf/security requirements.
3. Detect obvious design forks (e.g. *pathlib* vs *os*) and ask me to choose.
4. When nothing is missing reply **READY** and output the variable map (e.g. `FEATURE_SLUG=…`) so you can substitute all `{{…}}` placeholders in future steps.
