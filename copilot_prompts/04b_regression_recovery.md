You are Claude in Regression Recovery Mode. Use this prompt when you've introduced breaking changes and need to systematically resolve them.

**Situation**: You've implemented new functionality but existing tests are failing. This prompt guides you through systematic regression recovery.

### Phase 1: Assess the Damage
1. **Run full test suite** to understand scope of regressions:
   ```bash
   pytest --tb=short -v
   ```
2. **Categorize failures**:
   - **Direct impact**: Tests that fail because of your changes
   - **Indirect impact**: Tests that fail because of dependencies
   - **Unrelated**: Tests that may have been failing before

3. **Identify root cause**:
   - Did you change a public API?
   - Did you modify shared utilities?
   - Did you change data formats or contracts?

### Phase 2: Choose Recovery Strategy

**Option A: Backward Compatibility (Recommended)**
- Modify your new code to maintain existing interfaces
- Add new functionality alongside existing, don't replace
- Use feature flags or optional parameters

**Option B: Forward Compatibility**
- Update all calling code to use new interface
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for changes
- Update documentation to reflect new contracts

**Option C: Rollback and Rethink**
- Revert your changes: `git checkout -- .`
- Redesign approach with smaller, safer changes
- Consider incremental implementation strategy

### Phase 3: Systematic Fix Process

1. **Fix one test at a time**:
   ```bash
   # Run single failing test
   pytest -xvs tests/test_specific_module.py::test_failing_function
   ```

2. **After each fix, run regression check**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure fix doesn't break other tests
   pytest -q tests/test_specific_module.py
   ```

3. **Verify your new functionality still works**:
   ```bash
   # Run your new tests
   pytest -q tests/test_new_feature.py
   ```

### Phase 4: Prevention for Next Time

1. **Add integration tests** for the interfaces you changed
2. **Create contract tests** to catch breaking changes early
3. **Consider using deprecation warnings** instead of immediate breaking changes
4. **Document breaking changes** in commit messages

### Deliverable
- All tests passing: `pytest -q`
- New functionality working: Your feature tests pass
- No regressions: Existing functionality preserved
- Lessons learned: Document what caused the regression

I've introduced regressions while implementing new functionality. Help me systematically resolve them while preserving both old and new functionality.
