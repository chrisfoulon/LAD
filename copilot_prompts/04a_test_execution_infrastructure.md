# Test Execution Infrastructure for GitHub Copilot

## Overview
This module provides systematic test execution capabilities that prevent timeouts and establish comprehensive baseline analysis for large test suites. Designed for GitHub Copilot's function-based and comment-driven development approach.

    """
    Execute test category using proven chunking strategy to prevent timeouts
    
    Implements intelligent chunking based on test category complexity:
    - Security tests: 10-20 tests per chunk (fast, stable execution)
    - Model registry: Split into logical chunks (local, API, database)
    - Integration tests: 5-10 tests per chunk (complex setup)
    - Performance tests: Individual or small groups (timeout-prone)
    
    Args:
        test_category: Category like 'security', 'model_registry', 'integration'
        chunk_size: Override default chunk size if needed
        timeout_seconds: Maximum execution time per chunk
        
    Returns:
        TestExecutionResult with comprehensive execution metadata
        
    Example usage:

## Usage Patterns for Copilot

### 1. Basic Test Execution Setup
```python
# Initialize test execution infrastructure
# This comment prompts Copilot to create setup code for comprehensive test analysis

test_executor = TestExecutionInfrastructure()  # Copilot will suggest class structure
```

### 2. Category-Specific Execution
```python
# Execute security tests with timeout prevention
# Use proven chunk size for fast, stable security test execution
# Generate comprehensive results with health metrics

security_results = execute_test_chunk_with_timeout_prevention('security')

# Execute model registry tests with intelligent chunking
# Split into logical groups: local, API, database tests
# Handle complex setup requirements with appropriate timeouts

registry_results = execute_test_chunk_with_timeout_prevention('model_registry')
```

### 3. Comprehensive Baseline Establishment
```python
# Establish complete test baseline for improvement tracking
# Perform test discovery across all categories
# Generate health metrics and success rate baselines
# Create structured documentation for analysis phase

baseline_results = establish_comprehensive_test_baseline()
health_metrics = aggregate_test_results_across_categories(baseline_results)
```

### 4. Token-Efficient Execution
```python
# Execute large test suites with token optimization
# Capture comprehensive output while filtering for critical information
# Preserve detailed results for later analysis
# Return optimized summary for immediate processing

filtered_output, full_file = optimize_test_execution_for_token_efficiency(
    'pytest tests/large_category/ -v --tb=short',
    'large_category'
)
```
