    """
    Perform holistic pattern recognition across ALL test failures
    
    Instead of analyzing failures sequentially, this function aggregates
    all failures first to identify:
    - Cascading failure patterns (one root cause affects multiple tests)
    - Cross-cutting concerns (similar issues across different modules)
    - Solution interaction opportunities (single fix resolves multiple issues)
    
    Args:
        test_execution_results: Complete test results from execution phase
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping failure categories to structured failure objects
        
    Implementation approach:
        1. Extract all FAILED and ERROR entries from comprehensive results
        2. Apply root cause taxonomy classification to each failure
        3. Group failures by category and identify recurring patterns
        4. Map interdependencies and solution interaction opportunities
        5. Assign initial priority based on impact and complexity assessment
        
    Pattern recognition strategies:
        - Import failures: Look for missing modules, dependency issues
        - API failures: Detect signature mismatches, interface changes
        - Test design failures: Identify brittle assertions, wrong expectations
        - Configuration failures: Find path issues, service dependencies
        - Coverage gaps: Locate untested integration points

## Usage Patterns for Copilot

### 1. Pattern Recognition Analysis
```python
# Perform holistic pattern recognition across all test failures
# Aggregate failures from all categories before individual analysis
# Identify cascading patterns and cross-cutting concerns
# Map solution interaction opportunities

categorized_failures = aggregate_failure_patterns_across_categories(test_results)
cross_cutting_concerns = identify_cross_cutting_concerns(categorized_failures)
```

### 2. Industry Standards Validation
```python
# Validate test failures against multiple industry standards
# Apply research software, enterprise, IEEE, and solo programmer contexts
# Generate comprehensive justification analysis
# Determine priority levels based on multi-standard assessment

validated_failures = []
for category, failures in categorized_failures.items():
    for failure in failures:
        # Apply multi-tier validation to each failure
        validation_results = validate_test_against_industry_standards(failure)
        failure.industry_justification = validation_results
        validated_failures.append(failure)
```

### 3. Priority Matrix Generation
```python
# Generate resource-optimized priority matrix
# Consider impact, effort, batching opportunities, and dependencies
# Optimize for solo programmer resource constraints
# Identify quick wins and high-value fixes

priority_matrix = generate_priority_matrix_with_effort_analysis(
    validated_failures, 
    cross_cutting_concerns
)
```

### 4. Solution Interaction Mapping
```python
# Map solution interactions and implementation dependencies
# Identify compatible fixes for batching
# Determine optimal implementation sequence
# Assess risk levels for regression prevention

solution_interactions = map_solution_interactions_and_dependencies(priority_matrix)
```

### 5. Implementation Context Preparation
```python
# Generate comprehensive analysis summary
# Prepare structured context for PDCA implementation cycles
# Create implementation-ready priority queue
# Optimize resource allocation for efficient execution

analysis_summary = generate_comprehensive_analysis_summary(
    priority_matrix,
    solution_interactions, 
    cross_cutting_concerns
)

implementation_context = prepare_implementation_context_for_pdca_cycles(analysis_summary)
```
