## Usage Patterns for Copilot

### 1. PDCA Cycle Initialization
```python
# Initialize PDCA cycle with prioritized tasks from analysis
# Set up TodoWrite-style progress tracking
# Define success criteria and validation requirements
# Organize tasks by priority and batch compatible fixes

pdca_cycle, progress_tracker = initialize_pdca_cycle_with_prioritized_tasks(
    implementation_context,
    cycle_number=1
)
```

### 2. Systematic Implementation Execution
```python
# Execute DO phase with progress tracking
# Implement fixes based on root cause analysis
# Update task status in real-time
# Document implementation decisions and approaches

implementation_results = execute_systematic_implementation_with_progress_tracking(
    pdca_cycle,
    progress_tracker
)
```

### 3. Comprehensive Validation
```python
# Perform CHECK phase validation with regression prevention
# Run targeted tests for implemented fixes
# Verify integration points and critical system functionality
# Update health metrics and compare with baseline

validation_report = perform_comprehensive_validation_with_regression_prevention(
    implementation_results,
    pdca_cycle
)
```

### 4. User Decision Framework
```python
# Generate ACT phase decision framework
# Present structured options with specific metrics
# Provide technical recommendations based on analysis
# Track user decision patterns for optimization

decision_prompt = generate_user_decision_framework_with_options(
    validation_report,
    pdca_cycle,
    progress_tracker
)

print(decision_prompt)  # Present options to user
```

### 5. Session Continuity Management
```python
# Save comprehensive session state for resumption
# Preserve PDCA cycle progress and TodoWrite state
# Document key findings and implementation decisions
# Prepare context for next session

save_comprehensive_session_state_for_resumption(
    pdca_cycle,
    progress_tracker,
    cycle_findings
)
```

### 6. Coverage Integration (Option C)
```python
# Integrate coverage analysis with test quality improvement
# Identify critical coverage gaps requiring attention
# Link coverage improvements to existing test failure patterns
# Balance test quality fixes vs coverage enhancement

enhanced_context = integrate_coverage_analysis_with_pdca_cycles(
    current_implementation_context,
    ['emuses.model_registry', 'emuses.analysis', 'emuses.security']
)
```
